# Introduction #

Matt Helliwell has generously given me committer rights, and I have uploaded a lot of changes, most of them cosmetic.


# Details #

First, there are two manuals. User.htm is for people who want to run tests. Tech.htm is for people who want to understand what the code does and/or make changes. Please be critical of these and log any issues so that I can improve the documentation.

Second, I have fixed (I believe - again, please be critical) the two issues that were outstanding.

Third, I have added some functionality. "Coverage" will tell you how many procedures in a module have tests, although this won't tell you how good the tests are. "RetroFit" will create a "Tester" module for an existing module, together with test stubs, one per procedure in the module being tested. Read the user manual for more information.

I haven't tested anything with Matt's GUI, as I am planning to build a GUI from scratch to be compatible with other code that I have written and am writing. More details when I know what's possible!
